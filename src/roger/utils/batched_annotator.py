"""Batch the per-identifier lookups dug makes while annotating an element.

dug resolves identifiers one at a time (`AnnotateSapbert.__call__`):

    for entity, raw_identifiers in raw_identifiers_dict.items():
        for identifier in raw_identifiers:
            norm_id = self.normalizer(identifier, http_session)
            norm_id.synonyms = self.synonym_finder(norm_id.id, http_session)

Both services accept a list and answer it in about the time they take to
answer one. Measured against the deployed translator-dev services, per curie:

    n=1     normalize 10.34 ms   synonyms 25.82 ms
    n=200   normalize  0.13 ms   synonyms  0.13 ms

An element with 150 identifiers spends ~5.4 s in that loop and ~50 ms
batched. The two phases stay serial with respect to each other, because
synonyms are looked up by the *normalized* curie and so normalization has to
finish first -- but that is 2 requests instead of 300.

sapbert is deliberately left alone: the service takes a single `text` and
422s on any list form, and it is called once per classified entity rather
than once per identifier, so it is not what makes the loop expensive.
